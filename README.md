### Description

To start off with I looked at the API and I identified how it would look and in terms of the component hierarchy

The libraries I used here were React Router as this has enabled the user to see multiple views when going through the URLS. I have also used state here as this is a hook that allows the user to have state variables in functional components as we can declare a news state variable. I have also used effect here as I want to tell React that it needs to do something after it renders

If I had more time:

## Improvements:

- Improved the CSS and styling elements of the app

### Code Improvements:

- Used `Typescript` instead of `Javascript` for better code quality
- Add more tests with Cypress(only basic setup was done)
- Design and UX --> invest more time in responsive

### New Features:

- Used a button so that the user would have clicked on the main page to go to the api card page
- Add pagination as this would have helped the user click on different pages
- Added a back button on the individual card page which was displaying the api so it would have improved the user experience
