### Description

To start off with I looked at the API and I identified how it would look,

The libraries I used here were React Router to enable to go between one page and the next

If I had more time:

- i would have add pagination as this would have helped the user click on different pages
- I would have added a back button on the individual card page which was displaying the api so it would have improved the user expiereince
- Used Typescript instead of Javascript for better code quality
- I would have added a load more button
- i Would have also used a button so that the user would have clicked on the main page to go to the api card page

If I would had more time:

- would add pagination
- would add Typescript for code quality
- would add tests with Cypress
